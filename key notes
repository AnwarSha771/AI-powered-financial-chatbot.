Rule-based logic: Start by implementing rule-based responses. This means your chatbot will use predetermined responses to specific queries. Think of it as a sophisticated "if-then" logic: if the user asks "X," then the chatbot responds with "Y." This approach is ideal for handling frequently asked questions about financial data.

State management: Even in a simple chatbot, managing the conversation's state is important. This involves remembering the context of the conversation or the user's previous queries to make responses more relevant and personalized.

Error handling: Prepare your chatbot to handle unrecognized queries gracefully. It should inform users when it doesn't understand a question and guide them towards queries that it can respond to.
